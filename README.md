# pricing-page

## Disclaimer:
The files that are stored in this repository is the webpage I coded entirely based on [CHAKIT's pricing page](https://pusher.com/chatkit/pricing).
I coded everything up from scratch and I did this only to practice my HTML and CSS skills.
**All design credits belong to [PUSHER](https://pusher.com/).**
Should there be any issues, please feel free to contact me.
I will remove this repository as soon as possible.

## Why I chosen this webpage to practice?
The number 1 reason is that this webpage is aesthetically pleasing.
I like the color palette used on this webpage, which in my opinion is eye-catching but not aggressive.
Every element is harmoniously organized together.
The amount of animation is also moderate. 
I especially like the faq section where each question card has beautiful border radius and appropriate amount of box shadow.

If there is one thing that could be improved upon, 
I would say this webpage would be perfect if a slide-down effect could be added in the faq section when the button on the upper right corner of each card get clicked.
But this is just my opinion.

The second reason is that I wanted to challenge myself to code this webpage using HTML & CSS only, without JavaScript.
I think the animation done on this webpage is achievable with CSS and I think I'm right about it.
